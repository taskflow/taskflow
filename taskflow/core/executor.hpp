@class Executor

@brief class to create an executor 

An tf::Executor manages a set of worker threads to run tasks 
using an efficient work-stealing scheduling algorithm.

@code{.cpp}
// Declare an executor and a taskflow
tf::Executor executor;
tf::Taskflow taskflow;

// Add three tasks into the taskflow
tf::Task A = taskflow.emplace([] () { std::cout << "This is TaskA\n"; });
tf::Task B = taskflow.emplace([] () { std::cout << "This is TaskB\n"; });
tf::Task C = taskflow.emplace([] () { std::cout << "This is TaskC\n"; });

// Build precedence between tasks
A.precede(B, C);

tf::Future<void> fu = executor.run(taskflow);
fu.wait();  // block until the execution completes

executor.run(taskflow, [](){ std::cout << "end of 1 run"; }).wait();
executor.run_n(taskflow, 4);
executor.wait_for_all();  // block until all associated executions finish
executor.run_n(taskflow, 4, [](){ std::cout << "end of 4 runs"; }).wait();
executor.run_until(taskflow, [cnt=0] () mutable { return ++cnt == 10; });
@endcode

Most executor methods are @em thread-safe. 
For example, you can submit multiple taskflows to an executor concurrently 
from different threads, while other threads simultaneously create asynchronous tasks.

@code{.cpp}
std::thread t1([&](){ executor.run(taskflow); };
std::thread t2([&](){ executor.async([](){ std::cout << "async task from t2\n"; }); });
executor.async([&](){ std::cout << "async task from the main thread\n"; });
@endcode

@note

  // ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  /**
  @brief creates a task group that executes a collection of asynchronous tasks
  @return a tf::TaskGroup object associated with the current executor
 
  A TaskGroup allows submitting multiple asynchronous tasks to the executor
  and waiting for their completion collectively using `corun()`. Tasks added
  to the group can execute in parallel and may capture local variables by value
  or reference, depending on your needs. 
  This can be useful for divide-and-conquer
  algorithms, parallel loops, or any workflow that requires grouping related tasks.
  
  Example (computing Fibonacci numbers in parallel):

  @code{.cpp}
  tf::Executor executor;
  
  size_t fibonacci(size_t N) {

    if (N < 2) return N;
  
    size_t res1, res2;
  
    // Create a task group from the current executor
    tf::TaskGroup tg = get_executor().task_group();
  
    // Submit asynchronous tasks to the group
    tg.silent_async([N, &res1](){ res1 = fibonacci(N-1); });
    res2 = fibonacci(N-2);  // compute one branch synchronously
  
    // Wait for all tasks in the group to complete
    tg.corun();
  
    return res1 + res2;
  }
  
  int main() {
    return executor.async([](){ return fibonacci(30); }).get();
  }
  @endcode
  
  This member function is thread-safe.

  @note
  Due to cooperative execution, a task group can only be created by a worker of an executor.
