@section CancelARunningTaskflow Cancel Execution of Taskflows

When you submit a taskflow to an executor (e.g., tf::Executor::run), 
the executor returns a tf::Future object that will hold the result 
of the execution.
tf::Future is a derived class from std::future.
In addition to base methods of std::future,
you can call tf::Future::cancel to cancel the execution of a running taskflow.
The following example cancels a submission of a taskflow that contains
1000 tasks each running one second.

@code{.cpp}
tf::Executor executor;
tf::Taskflow taskflow;

for(int i=0; i<1000; i++) {
  taskflow.emplace([](){ 
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));
  });
}

// submit the taskflow
tf::Future<void> fu = executor.run(taskflow);

// request to cancel the above submitted execution
fu.cancel();

// wait until the cancellation completes
fu.get();
@endcode

@note
tf::Future::cancel is @em non-deterministic and @em out-of-order.

When you request a cancellation, the executor will stop scheduling 
the rest tasks of the taskflow.
Tasks that are already running will continue to finish, 
but their successor tasks will not be scheduled to run.
A cancellation is considered complete when all these running tasks finish.
To wait for a cancellation to complete, 
you may explicitly call @c tf::Future::get.

@attention
It is your responsibility to ensure that the taskflow remains alive before the 
cancellation completes.

For instance, the following code results in undefined behavior:

@code{.cpp}
tf::Executor executor;
{
  tf::Taskflow taskflow;
  
  for(int i=0; i<1000; i++) {
    taskflow.emplace([](){});
  }

  tf::Future fu = executor.run(taskflow);

  fu.cancel();  // there can still be task running after cancellation

} // destroying taskflow here can result in undefined behavior
@endcode

The undefined behavior problem exists because tf::Future::cancel does not
guarantee an immediate cancellation.
To fix the problem, call @c get to ensure the cancellation completes 
before the end of the scope destroys the taskflow.

@code{.cpp}
tf::Executor executor;
{
  tf::Taskflow taskflow;
  
  for(int i=0; i<1000; i++) {
    taskflow.emplace([](){});
  }

  tf::Future fu = executor.run(taskflow);

  fu.cancel();  // there can still be task running after cancellation
  fu.get();     // waits until the cancellation completes
}
@endcode

@section UnderstandTheLimitationsOfCancellation Understand the Limitations of Cancellation

Canceling the execution of a running taskflow has the following limitations:
  + Cancellation is non-preemptive. A running task will not be cancelled until it finishes.
  + Cancelling a taskflow with tasks
    acquiring and/or releasing tf::Semaphore results is currently not supported.

We may overcome these limitations in the future releases.
