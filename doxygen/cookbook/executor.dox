After you create a task dependency graph, you need to submit it to threads for execution.
In this chapter, we will show you how to execute a task dependency graph.

@tableofcontents

@section CreateAnExecutor Create an Executor

To execute a taskflow, you need to create an @em executor of type tf::Executor.
An executor is a @em thread-safe object that 
manages a set of worker threads and executes tasks
through an efficient @em work-stealing algorithm.
Issuing a call to run a taskflow creates a @em topology,
a data structure to keep track of the execution status of a running graph.
tf::Executor takes an unsigned integer to construct with @c N worker threads.
The default value is std::thread::hardware_concurrency.

@code{.cpp}
tf::Executor executor1;     // create an executor with the number of workers
                            // equal to std::thread::hardware_concurrency
tf::Executor executor2(4);  // create an executor of 4 worker threads
@endcode

An executor can be reused to execute multiple taskflows.
In most workloads, you may need only one executor to run multiple taskflows
where each taskflow represents a part of a parallel decomposition.

@section ExecuteATaskflow Execute a Taskflow

tf::Executor provides a set of @c run\_* methods,
tf::Executor::run, 
tf::Executor::run_n, and tf::Executor::run_until to run a taskflow
for one time, multiple times, or until a given predicate evaluates to true.
All methods accept an optional callback to invoke after the execution completes,
and return a tf::Future for users to access the execution status.
The code below shows several ways to run a taskflow.

@code{.cpp}
 1: // Declare an executor and a taskflow
 2: tf::Executor executor;
 3: tf::Taskflow taskflow;
 4:
 5: // Add three tasks into the taskflow
 6: tf::Task A = taskflow.emplace([] () { std::cout << "This is TaskA\n"; });
 7: tf::Task B = taskflow.emplace([] () { std::cout << "This is TaskB\n"; });
 8: tf::Task C = taskflow.emplace([] () { std::cout << "This is TaskC\n"; });
 9: 
10: // Build precedence between tasks
11: A.precede(B, C); 
12: 
13: tf::Future<void> fu = executor.run(taskflow);
14: fu.wait();                // block until the execution completes
15:
16: executor.run(taskflow, [](){ std::cout << "end of 1 run"; }).wait();
17: executor.run_n(taskflow, 4);
18: executor.wait_for_all();  // block until all associated executions finish
19: executor.run_n(taskflow, 4, [](){ std::cout << "end of 4 runs"; }).wait();
20: executor.run_until(taskflow, [cnt=0] () mutable { return ++cnt == 10; });
@endcode


Debrief:

@li Lines 6-8 create a taskflow of three tasks A, B, and C
@li Lines 13-14 run the taskflow once and wait for completion 
@li Line 16 runs the taskflow once with a callback to invoke when the execution finishes
@li Lines 17-18 run the taskflow four times and use tf::Executor::wait_for_all to wait for completion 
@li Line 19 runs the taskflow four times and invokes a callback at the end of the forth execution
@li Line 20 keeps running the taskflow until the predicate returns true

Issuing multiple runs on the same taskflow will automatically @em synchronize
to a sequential chain of executions in the order of run calls.

@code{.cpp}
executor.run(taskflow);         // execution 1
executor.run_n(taskflow, 10);   // execution 2
executor.run(taskflow);         // execution 3
executor.wait_for_all();        // execution 1 -> execution 2 -> execution 3
@endcode

@attention
A running taskflow must remain alive during its execution.
It is your responsibility to ensure a taskflow not being destructed
when it is running.
For example, the code below can result undefined behavior.

@code{.cpp}
tf::Executor executor;  // create an executor

// create a taskflow whose lifetime is restricted by the scope
{
  tf::Taskflow taskflow;
  
  // add tasks to the taskflow
  // ... 

  // run the taskflow
  executor.run(taskflow);

} // leaving the scope will destroy taskflow while it is running, 
  // resulting in undefined behavior
@endcode

Similarly, you should avoid touching a taskflow while it is running.

@code{.cpp}
tf::Taskflow taskflow;

// Add tasks into the taskflow
// ...

// Declare an executor
tf::Executor executor;

tf::Future<void> future = executor.run(taskflow);  // non-blocking return

// alter the taskflow while running leads to undefined behavior 
taskflow.emplace([](){ std::cout << "Add a new task\n"; });
@endcode

You must always keep a taskflow alive and must not modify it while 
it is running on an executor.

@section ExecuteATaskflowWithTransferredOwnership Execute a Taskflow with Transferred Ownership

You can transfer the ownership of a taskflow to an executor and run it without
wrangling with the lifetime issue of that taskflow.
Each @c run\_* method discussed in the previous section comes with an overload
that takes a @em moved taskflow object.

@code{.cpp}
tf::Taskflow taskflow;
tf::Executor executor;

taskflow.emplace([](){});

// let the executor manage the lifetime of the submitted taskflow
executor.run(std::move(taskflow));

// now taskflow has no tasks
assert(taskflow.num_tasks() == 0);
@endcode

However, you should avoid moving a @em running taskflow which can result in
undefined behavior.

@code{.cpp}
tf::Taskflow taskflow;
tf::Executor executor;

taskflow.emplace([](){});

// executor does not manage the lifetime of taskflow
executor.run(taskflow);

// error! you cannot move a taskflow while it is running
executor.run(std::move(taskflow));  
@endcode

The correct way to submit a taskflow with moved ownership to an executor is 
to ensure all previous runs have completed.
The executor will automatically release the resources of a moved taskflow
right @em after its execution completes.

@code{.cpp}
// submit the taskflow and wait until it completes
executor.run(taskflow).wait();

// now it's safe to move the taskflow to the executor and run it
executor.run(std::move(taskflow));  
@endcode

Likewise, you cannot move a taskflow that is running on an executor. 
You must wait until all the previous fires of runs on that taskflow complete
before calling move.

@code{.cpp}
// submit the taskflow and wait until it completes
executor.run(taskflow).wait();

// now it's safe to move the taskflow to another
tf::Taskflow moved_taskflow(std::move(taskflow));  
@endcode


@section ThreadSafety Touch an Executor from Multiple Threads

All @c run\_* methods are @em thread-safe.
You can have multiple threads call these methods from an executor to run different taskflows.
However, the order which taskflow runs first is non-deterministic and is up to the 
runtime.

@code{.cpp}
 1: tf::Executor executor;
 2:
 3: for(int i=0; i<10; ++i) {
 4:   std::thread([i, &](){
 5:     // ... modify my taskflow at i
 6:     executor.run(taskflows[i]);  // run my taskflow at i
 7:   }).detach();
 8: }
 9:
10: executor.wait_for_all();
@endcode

@section QueryTheWorkerID Query the Worker Identieir

Each worker in an executor has an unique integer identifier in the range 
<tt>[0, N)</tt> that can be queried by the caller thread using tf::Executor::this_worker_id.
If the caller thread is not a worker in the executor, @c -1 is returned.
This method is convenient for users to maintain a one-to-one mapping between
a worker and its application data structure.

@code{.cpp}
std::vector<int> worker_vectors[8];       // one vector per worker

tf::Taskflow taskflow;
tf::Executor executor(8);                 // an executor of eight workers

assert(executor.this_worker_id() == -1);  // master thread is not a worker

taskflow.emplace([&](){
  int worker_id = executor.this_worker_id();     // in the range [0, 8)
  auto& vec = worker_vectors[worker_id];
  // ...
});
@endcode

@section ObserveThreadActivities Observe Thread Activities

You can observe thread activities in an executor when a worker thread participates in executing
a task and leaves the execution using tf::ObserverInterface --
an @em interface class that provides a set of methods for you to define
what to do when a thread enters and leaves the execution context of a task.

@code{.cpp}
class ObserverInterface {
  virtual ~ObserverInterface() = default;
  virtual void set_up(size_t num_workers) = 0;
  virtual void on_entry(tf::WorkerView worker_view, tf::TaskView task_view) = 0;
  virtual void on_exit(tf::WorkerView worker_view, tf::TaskView task_view) = 0;
};
@endcode

There are three methods you must define in your derived class, 
tf::ObserverInterface::set_up, tf::ObserverInterface::on_entry, and 
tf::ObserverInterface::on_exit.
The method, tf::ObserverInterface::set_up, is a constructor-like method that 
will be called by the executor when the observer is constructed.
It passes an argument of the number of workers to observer in the executor.
You may use it to preallocate or initialize data storage, e.g., an independent vector for each worker.
The methods, tf::ObserverInterface::on_entry and
tf::ObserverInterface::on_exit,
are called by a worker thread before and after the execution context of a task,
respectively.
Both methods provide immutable access to the underlying worker and the running task
using tf::WorkerView and tf::TaskView.
You may use them to record timepoints and calculate the elapsed time of a task.

You can associate an executor with one or multiple observers (though one is common)
using tf::Executor::make_observer.
We use std::shared_ptr to manage the ownership of an observer.
The executor loops through each observer and invoke the corresponding methods accordingly.

@code{.cpp}
#include <taskflow/taskflow.hpp>

struct MyObserver : public tf::ObserverInterface {

  MyObserver(const std::string& name) {
    std::cout << "constructing observer " << name << '\n';
  }

  void set_up(size_t num_workers) override final {
    std::cout << "setting up observer with " << num_workers << " workers\n";
  }

  void on_entry(tf::WorkerView w, tf::TaskView tv) override final {
    std::ostringstream oss;
    oss << "worker " << w.id() << " ready to run " << tv.name() << '\n';
    std::cout << oss.str();
  }

  void on_exit(tf::WorkerView w, tf::TaskView tv) override final {
    std::ostringstream oss;
    oss << "worker " << w.id() << " finished running " << tv.name() << '\n';
    std::cout << oss.str();
  }

};

int main(){

  tf::Executor executor(4);

  // Create a taskflow of eight tasks
  tf::Taskflow taskflow;

  auto A = taskflow.emplace([] () { std::cout << "1\n"; }).name("A");
  auto B = taskflow.emplace([] () { std::cout << "2\n"; }).name("B");
  auto C = taskflow.emplace([] () { std::cout << "3\n"; }).name("C");
  auto D = taskflow.emplace([] () { std::cout << "4\n"; }).name("D");
  auto E = taskflow.emplace([] () { std::cout << "5\n"; }).name("E");
  auto F = taskflow.emplace([] () { std::cout << "6\n"; }).name("F");
  auto G = taskflow.emplace([] () { std::cout << "7\n"; }).name("G");
  auto H = taskflow.emplace([] () { std::cout << "8\n"; }).name("H");

  // create an observer
  std::shared_ptr<MyObserver> observer = executor.make_observer<MyObserver>(
    "MyObserver"
  );

  // run the taskflow
  executor.run(taskflow).get();

  // remove the observer (optional)
  executor.remove_observer(std::move(observer));

  return 0;
}
@endcode

The above code produces the following output:

@code{.bash}
constructing observer MyObserver
setting up observer with 4 workers
worker 2 ready to run A
1
worker 2 finished running A
worker 2 ready to run B
2
worker 1 ready to run C
worker 2 finished running B
3
worker 2 ready to run D
worker 3 ready to run E
worker 1 finished running C
4
5
worker 1 ready to run F
worker 2 finished running D
worker 3 finished running E
6
worker 2 ready to run G
worker 3 ready to run H
worker 1 finished running F
7
8
worker 2 finished running G
worker 3 finished running H
@endcode

It is expected each line of std::cout interleaves with each other 
as there are four workers participating in task scheduling.
However, the @em ready message always appears before the corresponding task message 
(e.g., numbers)
and then the  @em finished message.
